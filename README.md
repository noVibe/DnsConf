## Cloudflare vs NextDNS

Both providers have free plans, but there are some limitations

### Cloudflare limitations
+ 100 000 DNS requests per day
+ Ipv4 DNS requests are restricted by the only one IP. But you are free to use other methods: DoH, DoT, Ipv6
### NextDNS limitations
+ 300 000 DNS requests per month (still more than enough for personal use)
+ Slow API speed is restricted by 60 requests per minute. Takes significantly more time for script to save settings

### Cloudflare credentials setup
1) After signing up into a **Cloudflare**, navigate to _Zero Trust_ tab and create an account.
- Free Plan has decent limits, so just choose it.
- Skip providing payment method step by choosing _Cancel and exit_ (top right corner)
- Go back to _Zero Trust_ tab

2) Create a **Cloudflare API token**, from https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens

with 2 permissions:

    Account.Zero Trust : Edit

    Account.Account Firewall Access Rules : Edit

Set API token to **environment variable** `AUTH_SECRET`

3) Get your **Account ID** from : https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers

Set **Account ID** to **environment variable** `CLIENT_ID`

### NextDNS credentials setup
1) Generate **API KEY**, from https://my.nextdns.io/account and set as **environment variable** `AUTH_SECRET`

2) Click on **NextDNS** logo. On the opened page, copy ID from Endpoints section.
   Set it as **environment variable** `CLIENT_ID`


## Setup profile
Set **environment variable** `DNS` with DNS provider name (**Cloudflare** or **NextDNS**)

## Setup data sources
Each data source must be a link to a hosts file, e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Internet-Helper/GeoHideDNS/refs/heads/main/hosts/hosts

You can provide multiple sources split by coma:
https://first.com/hosts,https://second.com/hosts

### 3) Setup exclusions
Set domains to **environment variable** `EXCLUDE` to skip adding them from both `BLOCK` and `REDIRECT` sources.

You can provide multiple domains split by comma:
`instagram.com,example.org`

Exclusions also work for subdomains. If `instagram.com` is excluded, then entries like `instagram.com`, `b.i.instagram.com`, `help.instagram.com` will be ignored.

### 1) Setup Redirects
Set sources to **environment variable** `REDIRECT`

Script will parse sources, filtering out redirects to `0.0.0.0` and `127.0.0.1`

Thus, parsing lines:

    0.0.0.0 domain.to.block
    1.2.3.4 domain.to.redirect
    127.0.0.1 another.to.block

will keep only `1.2.3.4 domain.to.redirect` for the further redirect processing.


+ Redirect priority follows sources order. If domain appears more than one time, the first only IP will be applied.


### 2) Setup Blocklist
Set sources to **environment variable** `BLOCK`

Script will parse sources, keeping only redirects to `0.0.0.0` and `127.0.0.1`.

Thus, parsing lines

    0.0.0.0 domain.to.block
    1.2.3.4 domain.to.redirect
    127.0.0.1 another.to.block

will keep only `domain.to.block` and `another.to.block` for the further block processing.

+ You may want to provide the same source for both `BLOCK` and `REDIRECT` for **Cloudflare**.
+ For **NextDNS**, the best option might be to set `REDIRECT` only, and then manually choose any blocklists at the _Privacy_ tab.

## Script Behaviour
### Cloudflare
Previously generated data will be removed. Script recognizes old data by marks:


+ Name prefix for List: **_Blocked websites by script_** and **_Override websites by script_**
+ Name prefix for Rule: **_Rules set by script_**
+ Different **_Session id_**. **_Session id_** is stored in a description field.


After removing old data, new lists and rules will be generated and applied.

If you want to clear **Cloudflare** block/redirect settings, launch the script without providing sources in related **environment variables**. E.g. providing no value for **environment variable** `BLOCK` will cause removing old related data: lists and rules used to setup blocks.

### NextDNS

For `REDIRECT`:
+ Existing domain will be updated if redirect IP has changed
+ If new domains are provided, they will be added
+ The rest redirect settings are kept untouched

For `BLOCK`:
+ If new domains are provided, they will be added
+ The rest block settings are kept untouched

Previously generated data is removed **ONLY** when both `BLOCK` and `REDIRECT` sources were not provided.

## GitHub Actions setup

#### Step-by-step video guide: [REDIRECT for NextDNS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbAXM_xAL5I)

#### Steps

1) Fork repository
2) Go _Settings_ => _Environments_
3) Create _New environment_ with name `DNS`
4) Provide `AUTH_SECRET` and `CLIENT_ID` to **Environment secrets**
5) Provide `DNS`,`REDIRECT`, `BLOCK` and optional `EXCLUDE` to **Environment variables**

+ The action will be launched every day at **01:30 UTC**. To set another time, change cron at `.github/workflows/github_action.yml`
+ You can run the action manually via `Run workflow` button: switch to _Actions_ tab and choose workflow named **DNS Block&Redirect Configurer cron task**
